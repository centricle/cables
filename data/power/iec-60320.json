  "confusion_points": [
    "C13 fits into C14 inlets, C14 is the plug on the device - confusing naming",
    "C13 and C15 look similar but C15 has a notch and is rated for higher temperatures",
    "C15 plugs fit C14 inlets, but C13 plugs do NOT fit C16 inlets (safety feature)",
    "C19/C20 are for high-power equipment - using C13/C14 cables can cause overheating",
    "Odd numbers are cable-side connectors, even numbers are appliance inlets",
    "Voltage rating is 250V but actual voltage depends on your country's mains (120V US, 230V EU)",
    "Cable amperage rating must meet or exceed device requirements"
  ],
  "buying_guide": "For computers and monitors, standard C13-to-wall-plug cables work. Match your wall plug type to your country. For servers and high-power equipment, verify you need C19/C20. Check amperage ratings - don't use thin cables on high-draw equipment. For kettles and hot appliances, use C15 cables rated for high temperature.",
  "notes": "IEC 60320 connectors standardized appliance power connections worldwide. The ingenious aspect is separating the appliance connector (universal) from the wall plug (country-specific), so manufacturers can ship one product globally with different power cables. C13/C14 dominates computing, while C19/C20 handles data center and high-power needs.",
