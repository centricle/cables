          Which USB cable do I need? The answer should be simple. It never is. USB-A, USB-C, Micro-B, Mini-B, Thunderbolt, Lightning — and that's just USB. Add video cables, audio cables, and power cables to the mix and you're deep in a rabbit hole of specs and compatibility charts.

        <p class="text-lg">
          I built cables.fyi because every time I needed to buy a cable, I ended up doing twenty minutes of research that should have taken twenty seconds. One place, all the specs, no opinions.
